MeasureDistanceBetweenTwoPennies
================================

This Qt project uses OpenCV to measure the distance between two pennies placed on a standard 8.5" x 11" piece of paper. It first finds the corners of the paper and transforms the image to make it orthogonal. It then performs blob analysis to find the pennies and calculate the distance between them using the 8.5x11 paper as reference.
